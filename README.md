Penn State MacAdmins
--------------------

This repository will house the scripts I have created over the years to manage macOS devices. These scripts are available for anyone's use but obviously are use at your own risk as what works in my environemnt may not work in yours. These are provided strictly as reference.

Most of these scripts will rely on either the now defunct preinstall macOS Python or a Python pkg I install on all our machines using Greg Neagle's wonderful [Relocatable Python](https://github.com/gregneagle/relocatable-python) project.
